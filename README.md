# My Data Science Project

## Intro

A step-by-step complete Data Science project: from Business problem description to solution and implementation (with code). Using Foursquare API, Beautiful soup, Requests, Pandas, and Folium, I aquire data from the open data bases (by web scraping), perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), and then make visualizations to draw the conclusions.

## Motivation

Nowadays, more and more people are "going green", i.e., moving towards a healthier lifestyle - not only by increasing daily movements but also by choosing the healthier products (wild-caught, locally-produced, bio+, organic  -  you name it).

The underlying reason may be an increasing knowledge about nutrition and health, and/or increasing availability of clean sources of food. In both cases, I totally support this movement. As the number of "health-is-priority" people grows, so the number of organic stores as well. 

### I want to create some value for others, so why not try to catch up with this trend by opening a new Organic Shop!

In my view, a good business is one oriented towards values, growth, and a vision for the future. Building an organic store has the potential to bring value to our customers, make profit, and increase it in the future as more and more people will be joining this healthy movement.

### In this project, I will be exploring Amsterdam neighborhoods to find out the best place to open a new organic shop.
